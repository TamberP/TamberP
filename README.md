Meowdy;

I'm Tamber. (shi/hir usually, but not always)

Currently employed in the "hitting trucks with hammers" sector, in the North-West of England.

Main skill: Winging-It as a Service (WIaaS)\
I build/rapidly iterate on junk, on far too little sleep, and with far too little time to work on any of it between real-world obligations.

- Slapped some beige on TGStation code from 2020 and turned it into [TetraStation](https://github.com/TetraStation/TetraStation)
- Dragged some scattered info together in order to make [byond.topic](https://github.com/TamberP/byond.topic)
- Hammered together [a crude py3/tkinter application for accessing the UK DoT's brake-tester database](https://github.com/TamberP/dtp-base), while fried out of my head with COVID.
- Half-ass reverse-engineered the game code end of Goonstation SpaceBee interface, to make just enough of an interface for the *other end* to link to Discord for round-announcements, admin notices, player help requests, and the like for [CoolStation](https://github.com/coolstation/coolstation)
- Half-ass reverse-engineered TG's TGS interface, and tying myself in software architectural knots trying to come up with *at least* a half-baked approximation of TG's tgstation-server, as [Tetraserv](https://github.com/TamberP/tetraserv)
- Bashed together the obligatory static blog generator, forever ago: [Klompen](https://github.com/TamberP/klompen)
